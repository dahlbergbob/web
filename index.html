                <h3>The short version</h3>
                <p>
                    I have been a developer since I started my first company at high school. I've built large campaign frameworks, several video players and chats, streaming services, mobile apps and micro services to support them. At the moment my main languages are Kotlin, Java and Scala and my main platforms are Android and AWS. I've always been an asynchronous programmer since day one and started with scripting languages so I love that almost every discussion today in the software world is addressing both reactive and functional. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also always been very into sports. Been playing hockey on highest level as a junior and been a coach for several years when I was younger. Then a short period of time I didn't exercise at all and all work, that was not a good solution for me and now I'm back to work out at least 4 times a week. Doing crossfit, playing hockey or running obstacle course races. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One common thing during both sporting and development is that I love to solve a problem. I'm consistent, persistent, head first and I am driven by passion and results. I often end up leading, and that is something I'm comfortable with when I have the basic knowledge to ask the right questions.
                </p>
